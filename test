CloudWatch Metrics is the primary source of metrics emitted by AWS-managed services (e.g. RDS, Lambda, API Gateway). These metrics are used directly by SREs for AWS service health monitoring and may be optionally ingested into New Relic for correlation with application-level signals.
CloudWatch Logs serves as the native ingestion point for logs generated by AWS services and platform components. For most application workloads, logs are forwarded downstream (e.g. via Fluentd) to the ELK stack for centralized search, correlation, and long-term retention.
While CloudWatch provides foundational AWS-level telemetry, application-level metrics, tracing, and APM are handled primarily by New Relic, and CloudWatch should be treated as the source of AWS-native signals rather than a full application observability platform.
